                        <li>Decide on the size and shape of your wall hanging.</li>
                        <li>Sketch out a rough design to visualize the arrangement of knots and patterns.</li>
                        <li>Consider incorporating different knot styles like square knots, half knots, or lark's head
                            knots.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Cut and Arrange Cord:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cut several pieces of cord to your desired length, allowing for extra length to tie knots
                            and for fringe at the bottom.</li>
                        <li>Arrange the cords evenly along the dowel or ring, leaving space between each one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Start Knotting:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin by securing the cords to the dowel or ring using lark's head knots.</li>
                        <li>Experiment with different knot patterns, alternating colors or textures if you have multiple
                            cords.</li>
                        <li>Follow your design sketch, tying each knot carefully and adjusting tension as needed.</li>

                <li><strong>Finish and Trim:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once you've reached the desired length for your wall hanging, tie off the cords at the
                            bottom using a secure knot.</li>
                        <li>Trim any excess cord to create a neat fringe or tassel effect.</li>
                        <li>Hang your completed macramé wall hanging in your desired location and enjoy your handcrafted
                            decor!</li>

                <dt>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</dt>
                <dd>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes
                    include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI is used in various applications such as natural
                    language processing, image recognition, and robotics.</dd>

                <dt>Blockchain</dt>
                <dd>Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that records transactions across
                    multiple computers in a way that is secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant. It forms the
                    foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and has applications in supply chain management,
                    finance, and voting systems.</dd>

                <dt>Cloud Computing</dt>
                <dd>Cloud computing involves delivering computing services—including servers, storage, databases,
                    networking, software, and more—over the internet ('the cloud'). It allows users to access resources
                    on-demand, without the need for local infrastructure, and is commonly used for data storage,
                    software deployment, and processing power.</dd>

                <dt>Internet of Things (IoT)</dt>
                <dd>The Internet of Things refers to the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, appliances, and
                    other items—embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange
                    data. IoT technology enables the automation of various tasks, improving efficiency and convenience
                    in areas like home automation, healthcare, and industrial processes.</dd>

                <dt>Virtual Reality (VR)</dt>
                <dd>Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment that allows users to interact
                    with and experience a virtual world as if they were physically present in it. VR technology
                    typically involves the use of headsets and controllers to immerse users in a three-dimensional
                    environment, and it finds applications in gaming, training, education, and therapy.</dd>
